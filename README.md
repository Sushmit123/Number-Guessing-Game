🌡️ Excited to share my second project at Prodigy Infotech: Number Guessing game using JSP and Servlets!

This web application implements a classic guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 

🖥️ Key Features:
Responsive design with a modern UI.
Real-time feedback on user guesses.
Session management to keep track of attempts.
Dynamic rendering of pages using JSP.

Explore the code, contribute, or use it as a reference for your projects! 🔧💻
